This repository contains the progress of the projects I do during my internship in Infotach Solutions

Project 1: Real-Time B2B SaaS Collaboration Workspace (Slack/Notion Clone) 
Executive Problem Statement:

Modern remote teams require centralized workspaces that combine real-time communication with document collaboration. Legacy HTTP-based polling applications fail to provide the instant synchronization teams expect, leading to severe API latency and poor user experiences. The objective of this project is to architect a highly scalable, real-time collaboration platform. The intern will build a system where users can create "Workspaces," chat in real-time channels, and co-edit simple documents. The engineering focus is strictly on horizontal scalability, utilizing WebSockets and Redis to handle concurrent connections efficiently. 

Business Objectives and Key Performance Indicators:

The strategic vision is to build a stateless backend architecture capable of handling thousands of real-time events without crashing. Success will be measured by the application's ability to broadcast messages to connected clients instantly without relying on continuous HTTP polling. The frontend must deliver a seamless, app-like experience with zero full-page reloads. 

Minimum Viable Product Specifications 

The foundational feature is the REST API and split architecture. The backend must manage user sessions using JWTs, while the React 19 frontend consumes these APIs. 
The core operational module is the WebSocket Server. The intern must configure Socket.IO alongside the Express server. 
To ensure the chat scales, Redis must be implemented to manage the shared state and pub/sub messaging across potentially multiple server instances.
